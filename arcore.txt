ArCore is a type of software developement kit developed by google that allows augmented reality concept based apps to be built
. Arcore forms an important part of AR based applications as it provides a varitey of tools for using and understanding
a wide variety of oobjects in the real world around us. Various tools included in this are enviornmental understanding
, which enables the devices to understand and detect the ertical and horizontal planes, motion tracking as well as
complex object detection, also here motion tracking lets phones understand their respective positions and relatively track 
them to the real world
A particular concept of light estimation API lets our digital objects to appear realistically- it seems that they're 
really a part of and belonging to real world. Also with ARcore elements we can use a set of common AR UI components which is earlier 
validate with help of user testing.
Also ARcore sue 3 key concepts of technologies to give integrated virtual content with the real world of comera.

Six degrees of freedom allows the phone to understand and track the position relative to the world.

Enviornment understanding which makes our phone to detect the location and the size of vertical or flat surface like floor,
wall or as dinning table.

Light estimation allows the phone to estimate the real worlds contract and lighting conditions.


*******************ADDING STEPS TO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE*******************
Distance calculation is the process where user can put two objects anywhere in real world and then will get the distance
between those objects, this could helpfull for getting the length of different things like you can measure the length
of your table, door etc. 

1.Define the sceneform fragment and listen for plane detection

2.After plan surface detected user can put two objects as AR Object on surface

3.Get the coordinates of two objects and calculate the distance between those coordinates and show on text.
